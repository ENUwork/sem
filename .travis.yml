# _________
# tells Travis we do not need sudo (super-user) access in this script.
# This will speed-up our builds.
sudo: false

# _________
# tells Travis to set a local hostname.
# We use db. This allows us to connect to our database container using the name db.
# We could have just used localhost but this is closer to
# reality which is the point of integration testing.
addons:
  hosts:
    - db

# _________
# Tells Travis which services we want.
# We add docker to ensure it is installed.
services:
  - docker

# _________
# provides an installation script.
# This is run before any job.
# Our install script will build the database container,
# start it the necessary parameters, and do an install build via Maven.
# The mvn install syntax used is the same called normally by Travis.
install:
  - docker build -t database db/.
  - docker run --rm -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example -p 33060:3306 database
  - mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V

# __________
# is a script that is run before any script part of a job.
before_script:
  - mvn clean

# __________
# This allows us to define build stages under a include item.
jobs:
  include:
    - stage: unit tests
      install: skip
      jdk: oraclejdk11
      script: mvn test -Dtest=com.napier.sem.AppTest

    - stage: integration tests
      jdk: oraclejdk11
      script: mvn test -Dtest=com.napier.sem.AppIntegrationTest

    - stage: deploy
      install: skip
      jdk: oraclejdk11
      script:
        - mvn package -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
        - docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit

# ___________
# We can also explicitly set the build stage order in a stages
# Notice we also add another item to the deploy stage: if: branch = master.
# This means the deploy stage will only occur when we push to the master branch.
stages:
  - unit tests
  - integration tests
  - name: deploy
    if: branch = master

# ____________
# We will use the after_success step to upload the reports to Codecov.
# This step takes place after the successful completion of a build stage.
after_success:
  - bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
